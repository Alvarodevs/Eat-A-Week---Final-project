## What is it ?

FoodAWeek is a tool to systematize the creation of weekly menus with many recipes at your fingertips.

Look for recipes! Make your menus! Save them! reuse them!

**Save time to eat great.**

## Why now!?

Why not? You are what you eat, fill your fridge with a plan for your stomach! And when you don't feel like it, save a week saved.
